# ActVib
Main Project for the ActVib Experimental System for Vibration Control and Analysis

The ActVib Project comprises the following sub-projects:
- A personalized PCB (print circuit board), which is used for connecting the an ESP32 board to DACs, ADCs, sensors, etc. More info at [ActVib Board @ OSHW Lab](https://oshwlab.com/dudubatista/ic-controle-ativo-de-vibra-es_copy).  
- ActVibFirmware: the firmware that runs on the ESP32.
- ActVibSoftware: a supervisory software for the system as whole. 
- A reference mechanical project for a structure that can be used for carrying out experiments with cantilever and fixed-ended beams.
- ActVibModules: helpers to work with data acquired using the ActVib system.
